Integromat is a powerful automation platform that enables you to connect and automate various applications and services. One of the key features of Integromat is the ability to utilize webhooks, which allow you to send data to Integromat over HTTP. Webhooks act as instant triggers, allowing you to execute scenarios immediately upon receiving a request at the webhook URL.

Integromat-Ruby is a lightweight Ruby gem that simplifies the process of triggering Integromat webhooks from any Ruby application. With just a few lines of code, you can seamlessly integrate your Ruby app with Integromat and automate various tasks.

To start using Integromat-Ruby, you'll need an Integromat account and a created webhook. If you're new to Integromat, don't worry â€“ setting up an account and creating a webhook is straightforward and well-documented on the Integromat website (https://make.com). Once you have your Integromat account and webhook ready, you're all set to integrate it with your Ruby application.
